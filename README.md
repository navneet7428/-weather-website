Project Description-During my project, I developed a Weather Application, a full-stack web app designed to provide real-time weather updates for any city worldwide. The application enables users to search for a location and instantly view details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall weather conditions, using data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API. The goal of the project was to create a reliable and user-friendly platform that demonstrates real-time API integration and data presentation.

The frontend of the application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with React.js for enhanced interactivity), offering a clean, responsive, and engaging user interface. The backend was implemented using Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests securely and efficiently. Additionally, the system was designed to process the raw API response, convert it into user-friendly formats, and deliver the results seamlessly to the frontend. For scalability, a database such as MongoDB can also be integrated to store user history or frequently searched cities.

This project highlights key concepts of full-stack development, including API consumption, client-server communication, and responsive design. By working on this app, I strengthened my skills in React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and API integration, while gaining practical experience in designing and deploying interactive, data-driven applications. The Weather App demonstrates not only technical proficiency but also the ability to build real-world solutions that combine usability with functionality.
